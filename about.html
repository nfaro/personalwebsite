                            I grew up in upstate NY in a town called Clifton Park, my lucky number is 2, I had done Tae Kwon Do since I was 
                            two years old and now have my fourth degree black belt, Silicon Valley is my favorite TV show, my favorite color 
                            is red, I collect vinyl records, I broke my hand trying to do tricks on my skis, I was a bioengineering major at 
                            MIT before my sophomore year, and I am really terrible at FIFA.

                            As time goes on year by year, we see technology being more and more present in our lives - whether that is through 
                            our devices in our hands, the services that keep us connected, or the simple conveniences that make our daily lives 
                            easier. As technology’s influence grows, we also need to make sure that its relationship with consumers grows with it. 
                            This is what I am extremely passionate about - I want to better the relationship between a person and their technologies, 
                            whether that is changing the way a device acts when a person is feeling a certain emotion, or changing the way we display 
                            services to people as they enter different stages of life. Customizing the way technology works with the individual is 
                            the most important thing in making sure that we do not take the humanity out of our innovations, and that is why I am 
                            so interested in computer science and all the potential that it has to offer.

                        When I was younger, I had an MIT hat hang on my nightstand next to my bed to remind me of my ultimate goal, which 
                        was to get into MIT. Now that that has been accomplished, I have a bunch of goals that I would like to accomplish 
                        by the time I end MIT. I’d like to start my own business before I leave, I’d like to at the least get my Master’s 
                        Degree here, and I’d like to TA a class just to name a few. I’d also like to be a coordinator for Camp Kesem and 
                        win a NEWMAC Championship with soccer - but most of all, I’d just like to look back on my years at MIT with a ton 
                        of amazing memories, as these years I know will be some of the best of my life.
